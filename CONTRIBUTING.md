 First of all, thank you for contributing! I am still learning new ways to improve my programming knowledge so I could use all the suggestions I can get.
 If you have any questions, suggestions, or want a new friend, heres my Discord ***@Butoteng#0189***.

## Submitting Changes
We all start somewhere, so if by any chance you're new to Github, I suggest using the **First Time Contributing** link at the top.

### First Time Contributors
Here are some tips for contributing a change:<br />

• Provided a detailed description of what you did. Try not to be vague. <br />
• Write commits in the present tense such as "Fix", "Add", "Change". <br />
• Try not to end the summary line with a period. <br />

## Found a Bug?
If you found a bug, create a new Issue up at the top and describe it as detailed as possible. Some tips to making one:<br />

  • Describe how to recreate the problem. <br />
  • Add some information about your system such as the OS, CPU, GPU, etc.

## Suggestions or New Ideas
I am open to new ideas to new commands with Marvel Heroes and Villains! Or, if you have any new suggestions to improve the functionality
of the bot, please don't hesitate to contribute. This bot currently supports (almost) all the original Avengers, but there's still so many
more heroes that can be added like Black Panther, Ant-Man, and Spider-Man
